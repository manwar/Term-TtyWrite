Term::TtyWrite - remote control a terminal via the TIOCSTI ioctl

NOTE OpenBSD has removed support for the TIOCSTI ioctl on account of
security concerns. This module will not work on such systems (or where
the OS never had it to begin with).

To install this module, use CPAN, for example:

  cpan Term::TtyWrite

Run perldoc(1) on Term::TtyWrite for additional documentation.


For the source code, see:

https://github.com/thrig/Term-TtyWrite

This can be built and installed by running:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
